      <description>Intro A few months ago I made an edutainment game for The Odin Project&amp;rsquo;s first game jame. My team had decided to build a game for practicing basic math. I took on the task of generating the problems as appropriate for each level of the game. It was hard! Generating random arithmetic expressions within certain difficulty constraints wasn&amp;rsquo;t simple. In order to enforce our constraints, I wrote my own script to evaluate expressions step by step so I could tell if my problems conformed to my difficulty constraints.</description>
