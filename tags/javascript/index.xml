      <description>Intro A few months ago I made an edutainment game for The Odin Project&amp;rsquo;s first game jame. My team had decided to build a game for practicing arithmetic expressions. I took on the task of generating the expressions as appropriate for each level of the game. It turned out to be rather challenging to generate random arithmetic expressions that were within certain difficulty constraints. For example, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the expression to evaluate to a negative number at any point along the evaluation path because we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to require knowledge of negative numbers.</description>
